# Project Title: Korea Covid-19 

### Description: 
This project explores a Covid-19 dataset made available by the Korean CDC and local governments and identifies policies and strategies that the Korean government implemented that may explain trends in cases and deaths. I was interested in this dataset because I had heard that the Korean government Covid control response was not as authoritarian as that of some other Asian countries, yet it was pretty effective in reducing infections and deaths.

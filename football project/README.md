# Project Title: Football matches project

### Turing College: Module 2, Sprint 4

### Description: 
This project explores a dataset on European football matches with the goal of using machine learning to predict match outcomes for betting. The dataset  contains data from 11 European country championships (ie. matches within each country). My knowledge of football/soccer is rather limited (I learnt about relegation only because I watched Ted Lasso!), so I limited this analysis to the following questions:

Q1. Which leagues are in which countries?
Q2. Which leagues score the most/fewest goals?
Q3. Who are the top scorers in each team and league?
Q4. Is there such a thing as home advantage?
Q5. Can we predict how many goals each team will score in each match?
Q6. Can we predict which team will win the match?
